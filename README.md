Website Used:
    The website used was Timeout Market's article: "The 50 best restaurants in NYC right now"
    https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/100-best-new-york-restaurants
    This website was chosen as there was a lot of information on each restaurant that we felt could be summarized into a shorter list. Additionally, when we want to find somewhere to eat, we often don't know what type of restaurant we want to eat at, so having an option to get a random recommendation helps users make a decision faster.
Purpose:
    The purpose of this program is to summarize information about the top 50 restaurants in NYC and provide an option to give a random recommendation to the user.
Features:
    1. Summarizes the top 50 restaurants
    2. Provides information about the restaurant name, type of cuisine, the general location, the rating, and a url to Timeout's review of the location(provided all the information is available for that restaurant)
    3. Allows users to ask for a random recommendation of a restaurant from the list until they find a restaurant they want to go to.
Prerequisites:
    1. Pip install all libraries in the requirements.txt file.
Usage:
    Run the program to receive the entire list of 50 restaurants.
    When asked if you want a random recommendation, type y to receive a random restaurant, type n to end the program.
